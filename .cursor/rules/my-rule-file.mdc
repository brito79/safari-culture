# Safari Culture - Wilderness Namibia Platform Instructions

## Project Overview
Building a luxury safari tourism platform for Wilderness Namibia showcasing 4 premium camps with sophisticated rate management, beautiful galleries, and admin capabilities. This is a **technical assessment project** following specific AWS and Next.js requirements.

## 🎯 Project Scope & Complexity
- **Complexity Level**: Medium - robust but maintainable
- **Focus**: Clean, professional, performant, preferably with a luxury aesthetic
- **Avoid**: Over-engineering, feature creep, excessive complexity
- **Goal**: Showcase modern development skills within manageable scope
- **Must Use**: Auth0 (App Router pattern for auth) and AWS Amplify Gen 2, RDS MySQL, S3 (as per test requirements)
- **Preference**: Always try implement server components and server-side rendering where possible

```

### Database Schema Rules
- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Handle seasonal rate gaps validation

## 🎨 UI/UX Standards

### Design Principles
- **Luxury Feel**: High-quality imagery, sophisticated typography
- **Mobile-First**: Tourism sites get heavy mobile traffic
- **Performance**: < 3s load times, optimized images
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance via Radix UI

### Component Standards
```typescript
// Use shadcn/ui patterns
- Consistent spacing (Tailwind scale)
- Proper loading states
- Error boundary handling
- Responsive design (320px, 640px, 1024px breakpoints)
- Dark/light mode support
```

### Image Guidelines
- Use Next.js Image component with S3 loader
- Implement proper alt tags for SEO
- Support multiple formats (WebP preferred)
- Lazy loading for galleries

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles
```typescript
interface UserRoles {
  public: 'VIEW_CAMPS' | 'VIEW_RATES' | 'SUBMIT_INQUIRY'
  admin: 'MANAGE_CAMPS' | 'MANAGE_RATES' | 'MANAGE_IMAGES' | 'VIEW_INQUIRIES'
}
```

### Auth Implementation (REQUIRED PATTERN)
```typescript
// Must use Auth0 as specified in test
// App Router components use getServerSession()
```

## 💻 Development Standards

### Code Quality
```typescript
// TypeScript Rules
- Strict mode enabled
- No 'any' types
- Proper interface definitions
- Use Zod for runtime validation

// Component Standards
- Functional components only
- Custom hooks for complex logic
- Proper prop typing
- Error boundaries for admin components

// State Management
- Local state (useState) for UI state
- Context for global app state (user, theme)
- useReducer for complex state logic (admin forms)
- No external state libraries (keep it simple)
```

### Performance Guidelines
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Use Next.js Image optimization
- Implement ISR for camp pages

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Consistent error patterns
- Use Error Boundaries
- Implement proper try/catch in async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Admin error logging to CloudWatch
```

## 📁 File Organization

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`CampCard.tsx`)
- Files/folders: kebab-case (`camp-details/`)
- Functions: camelCase (`calculateRate()`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`)

### Import Organization
```typescript
// Import order
1. React/Next.js imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Internal components
4. Types/interfaces
5. Utilities/helpers
```

## 🤖 AI Assistant Guidelines

When working on this project:
1. **Stay Focused**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
2. **Follow Standards**: Use the approved tech stack and patterns
3. **Think Business**: Remember this is luxury tourism, not e-commerce
4. **Be Practical**: Medium complexity, not over-engineered
5. **Test Requirements**: Don't deviate from specified AWS/Auth patterns
6. **Code Quality**: Write clean, documented, type-safe code
7. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile and fast loading
8. **User Experience**: Prioritize beauty and usability
9. **Use Context7 MCP**: When uncertain about implementations, deprecations, or best practices, always reference context7 MCP for current documentation and standards


### Integration Strategy
- Use context7 MCP proactively during development
- Reference real-time documentation rather than assumptions
- Validate implementation patterns before coding
- Ensure compatibility with latest versions of all dependencies

        

Remember: This is a **technical assessment**. Balance following requirements exactly with showcasing modern development skills using the most current and reliable patterns.
